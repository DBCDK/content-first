# User stories for Content First system

To offload the data I collected from Opensearch and other services, as a collector cron job, I want the Content First service to accept all the data I have with no delay; the service must get images and other stuff on its own time.

To spend as little time as possible to get book covers and to get covers only when I need them, as frontend, I want the backend to have an endpoint that gives me a cover image for a PID in the resolution I specify.
