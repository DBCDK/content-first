# Content First

The system currently runs on [`http://laesekompas.dk`](http://content-first.demo.dbc.dk), and you can get an overview of how it is composed in the [architecture description](doc/content-first-architecture.pdf).

For development of the system, see [`src`](src/readme.md).

## Development

    $ . /nvm.sh
    $ nvm install
    $ npm install
    $ cp env/integration.env current.env
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
    $ npm run start
    $ npm run fetch-inject-metakompas (cf must be started)
    $ npm run init-storage (cf must be started)
    
### Users for development and Cypress testing
Create normal user
`http://localhost:3000/v1/test/create/otto`

Create user and assign the editor role
`http://localhost:3000/v1/test/create/didrik?editor=true`

When multiple users are created, switch between them with
`http://localhost:3000/v1/test/login/otto`

## Deployment

The service's test database requires at least PostgreSQL 9.6, but the schemas only require support for JSONB.

To run the database tests against the server (requires postgresql):

    $ . /nvm.sh
    $ nvm install
    $ npm install
    $ cp env/integration.env current.env
    $ npm run test-acceptance --silent

To start the server in staging or production mode:

    $ . /nvm.sh
    $ nvm install
    $ npm install --production
    $ cp env/production.env current.env
    $ npm run start-backend

### required data files

Some json files need to be copied to [`src/data`](src/data) in order to build the application. Also check out which files are required for building and how to populate the app with data [`here`](src/data).

## Build server

Use the [exclude list](./tools/archive-excludes.txt) when the build server makes an archive file of the result of the build. Use like this:

    tar -X tools/archive-excludes.txt -cz -f $JOB_BASE_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER.tar.gz .
    
## Role management in content-first
Roles are managed through the ServiceProvider-Storage API

- Fetch token for the content-first admin client
- Fetch list of all roles:
```curl -X POST "https://openplatform.dbc.dk/v3/storage" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"access_token\": \"ACCESS_TOKEN\", \"scan\": {\"_type\": \"bf130fb7-8bd4-44fd-ad1d-43b6020ad102\", \"index\": [\"_owner\",\"name\"], \"startsWith\": [\"cf-admin\", \"role\"], \"expand\": true}}"```

- Find the uniqueId (culr-id) for the user you want to assign a role
- assign role, use the "_id" from the previously fetched role-object:
```curl -X POST "https://openplatform.dbc.dk/v3/storage" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"access_token\": \"ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN\", \"assign_role\": {\"userId\": \"USER_ID\", \"roleId\": \"ROLE_ID\"}}"```

## Environments

The backend service controlled by environment variables. Most scripts assume that such variables are set in your local file `current.env`. If you are just running the system on your own machine during development, you can most likely just use an empty `current.env`, but it has to exist. The [`env`](env/) directory holds templates for other used configurations. If you need to tweak settings, the application obeys the following environment variables.

| Environment variable          | Default               | Effect                                                                   |
